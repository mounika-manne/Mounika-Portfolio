    <section>
        <p>I am Dr. Mounika Manne, a dynamic and self-motivated GIS and Water Resources Engineer with over 8 years of research experience. My academic journey encompasses a Ph.D. in Remote Sensing and GIS, an M.E. in Irrigation and Water Management, and a B.Tech in Civil Engineering. My expertise spans remote sensing data processing, GIS analysis, and ecological modelling. I am deeply interested in developing innovative engineering solutions, particularly in environmental management, hydrological modelling, and water resource planning. My dedication to research and academia is demonstrated through my work at BITS Pilani and various industry projects where I have applied sophisticated spatial analysis techniques to address environmental and water resource challenges. I am deeply interested in environmental science and sustainability, which has driven my research and professional work.</p>
