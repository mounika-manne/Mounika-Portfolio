        <p><p>
        I am Mounika Manne, a dynamic and self-motivated GIS and Water Resources Engineer with over 9 years of research experience. 
        My academic journey encompasses a Ph.D. in Remote Sensing and GIS, an M.E. in Irrigation and Water Management, and a B.Tech in Civil Engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
        My expertise spans remote sensing data processing, GIS analysis, and ecological modeling. I am particularly passionate about developing 
        innovative engineering solutions in environmental management, hydrological modeling, and water resource planning. 
        My dedication to research and academia is demonstrated through my work at BITS Pilani and various industry projects, 
        where I have applied sophisticated spatial analysis techniques to address environmental and water resource challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
        My commitment to environmental science and sustainability drives my professional work and research, shaping the future 
        of resource management and conservation.
